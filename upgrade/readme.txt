Before updating, check your current version by logging into the admin dashboard (example.com/en-us/admin). 
 
If your current version of the script is older than the one specified in the file names of this directory, you can proceed with the upgrade. Simply extract the contents of "upgrade-x.x.x-to-[version].zip" and overwrite all the existing files in your script's web root directory. 
 
Begin by extracting the contents from the zip file corresponding to your current version. For instance, if you're at version 1.6.1, start with the  "upgrade-1.6.x-to-[version].zip" file, and skip "upgrade-1.x.x-to-1.6.0.zip". Then, proceed with all the subsequent upgrade zip files in the order of their version numbers. 
 
Please note: An update is only necessary if your installed version differs from the one in this zip file. If you've installed the same version as in this zip, no upgrade is needed.
